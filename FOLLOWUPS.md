# Follow-ups

Things known to be unfinished, thin, or deferred. Created 2026-08-29, in P1,
after two projects ran without one.

The rule for this file: an entry says what is wrong, how it was measured, and
what would settle it. "Look into X" is not an entry. If something here turns out
to be fine, the entry is deleted with a line in the commit saying so — not left
as a permanent worry.

### The first MLB forward predictions carry the pre-fix factor set

The **25 standing MLB forward predictions** — day 155 and day 156, written
2026-08-29 19:17 and 19:22 UTC — were made before the rolling-window leak was
found. Their factor vectors were computed with the UTC-date cutoff, so any of
them whose game falls on the ~24% of MLB dates where the league date differs may
have included the game in progress in its own rolling form.

**They stand, and that is deliberate.** LAW 3: a prediction cannot be edited,
deleted or re-scored after the fact. They were written blind and before first
pitch, so LAW 1 held. Re-writing them with corrected factors would be exactly
the re-scoring the law forbids, and voiding them would be discarding a real
forward record to tidy up an inconvenience.

But **the record should know its first resolutions came from a contaminated
factor set**, and this is where it is written down. When these resolve — the
first real resolutions this project has ever had — they enter the fs2 MLB
moneyline curve alongside later predictions made with the corrected cutoff. At
n=25 out of a 100-prediction gate they are a small share and will be a smaller
one by the time anything is claimable, but the mixture is real and is not
visible in the curve itself.

**What would settle it:** when MLB moneyline passes n=100, compute the curve
twice — with and without these 25 — and record whether the difference is
material. If it is, the honest move is to report the corrected-cutoff sample as
the headline and these as a footnote. Do not pre-judge which; measure it.

### Factors that fire too rarely to be tested

Each of these is **untested, not disproved**, and the distinction is the one
this project keeps insisting on. The backtest verdicts say so in those words.

| factor | fires in | measured |
|---|---|---|
| `nfl/prop_player_status` | 4.0% of rows | NFL backtest, 1,892 resolved |
| `nfl/neutral_site` | 2.2% of rows | NFL backtest, 1,892 resolved |
| `nba/nba_pace_rolling` | *inert* — barely moves any forecast | NBA backtest, 1,230 resolved |

`nba_pace_rolling` is the one to watch: it is not rare, it simply does nothing.
That may be correct — pace scales a margin, and a spread question already
carries the margin in `asked_line` — in which case it is redundant rather than
wrong. **What would settle it:** a forward season. If it is still inert at
n=100+ forward, retire it with a dated note saying redundancy, not refutation.

### `LIVE_TTL` is a blunt instrument

P1 split the fetch cache into `LIVE_TTL` (6h) and `LIVE_TODAY_TTL` (5min), keyed
on whether a fetched date range reaches today. That fixed the immediate failure —
a schedule cached at 19:10 still claimed every game was scheduled at 20:39 while
two were final upstream — but the split is coarse:

- The TTL is chosen by the *caller* passing `ttl_for_range`. A caller that
  forgets gets six hours and no warning.
- NFL and NBA loaders do not use it yet. Only MLB does, because MLB is the sport
  currently resolving.

**What would settle it:** make the TTL a property of the URL rather than the
call site, so forgetting is impossible.

### The margin SD for MLB is measured but unused

`MarginSD("mlb", 4.71, n=2110)` is recorded because the previous table had *no*
MLB key at all, so an MLB caller would have silently received football's 13.2
through a dict default. Gridiron asks no run-line question, so nothing reads it
today. It is here so that if a run-line market is ever added, the number is
already measured and dated rather than invented on the spot.

### Prop markets train on a quarter of eligible rows

Each NBA prop market sees roughly a quarter of eligible player-games, because
the stat rotation gives each player one stat per game. This is a **random
subsample** — the rotation is a crc32 of two identifiers and knows nothing about
performance — so it costs precision, not correctness. Training on all four stats
per player would quadruple rows and runtime and would fit on questions the live
slate never asks. Recorded so nobody "discovers" it later and assumes bias.

### The HTTP cache is copied into every scratch database

`copy_facts` duplicates `http_cache` — currently ~350MB — into each backtest or
verification database. Three backtest databases is over a gigabyte of duplicated
bytes. It is done for network politeness: without it, a season's backtest would
refetch months of ESPN days. **What would settle it:** copy only the cache rows
whose URLs the run will actually request.

### NBA prop fits are slow

~150s per market, ~10 minutes for all four, dominated by per-game context
construction. Acceptable for an occasional refit, uncomfortable for a weekly one.
An index on `nba_player_games(opponent, game_date)` already took this from over
an hour; the remaining cost is Python, not SQL.

## Resolved, kept for the record

### The rolling-window leak *(found and fixed 2026-08-29, P1)*

A game tipping after midnight UTC is the previous evening where it is played, so
its own game-log row is dated the day before its `kickoff_utc`. Every rolling
window cut on the UTC date therefore admitted the game being predicted into its
own rolling form, availability and pace — **76.8% of NBA games and 25.1% of MLB
ones**. The model was reading the result it was forecasting.

Fixed by `games.league_date`, carried from each source's own local date
(`officialDate`, `gameDateEst`), backfilled for 18,873 existing rows, with a
planted guard and a test stating the invariant by outcome.

This invalidated the NBA backtest entirely and a quarter of the MLB one. It also
produced at least one *downstream false finding*: `nba_back_to_back` was reported
firing in only 4.4% of games and judged a broken instrument, when the true
leak-free figure is 21.3%. **A leak does not only inflate scores; it manufactures
conclusions about factors.** Anything measured before 2026-08-29 should be
treated as suspect until recomputed.

**MLB's aggregate was unaffected and its published numbers stand.** 24% of MLB
games leaked, and the corrected backtest came back byte-for-byte identical:
MLB predictions cluster in one bucket, the affected factor has a small
coefficient, and one extra game in a 15-game window moves a near-coin-flip
probability by under a percentage point. NBA's leak hit 76.8% of games through a
10-game window with a large coefficient. Same bug, same fix, opposite
consequences — which is why the fix was verified per-sport by inspecting a stored
factor value rather than assumed from the diagnosis.

### The verifier was broken three separate ways *(fixed 2026-08-29, P1)*

`tools/verify.py` had not been run end to end in some time, and each failure hid
the next:

1. a positional `SELECT *` copy — the same bug fixed in `backtest.py`, duplicated
   here, so fixing one left the other broken;
2. `calibration.curve()` called without its required `sport` argument, an S1
   leftover from when LAW 6 made it mandatory;
3. `MAX(week)` taken across every sport, so an NFL-only step targeted **week
   155** — a baseball day number — found no football games, and reported that as
   a pipeline failure.

All three were in the tool whose job is to catch exactly this. A verifier that is
not run is not a verifier. **What would settle it:** P2's scheduler should run it,
not just `resolve`.

### The margin SD was assumed, not measured *(fixed 2026-08-29, P1)*

NBA's was written down as "~11.5 across recent seasons". Measured: 13.95, from
1,191 games. NFL's 13.2 against a measured 12.70 was close enough not to matter.
Neither explained the NBA model's apparent edge — the leak did — but an assumed
constant that decides how confident the *market* is made to look has no business
being unmeasured. `margin_sd()` now fails by name on anything undated.
